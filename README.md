# ansible-for-splunk-cloud

## Usage

:warning: Warning: These ansible playbooks will adjust configurations in your Splunk Cloud environment. In this process configurations like apps or indexes will get deleted when not configured in ansible correctly.

### Quickstart

1. Add your Splunk Cloud FQDN to `inventory/inventory.yml`.
2. Generate a token with an user which has the [required capabilities](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Config/ACSreqs). The `sc_admin` role has all required capabilities by default.
3. Encrypt the token with `ansible-vault` and place it into `inventory/*/host_vars/vars.yml`.
4. Encrypt your splunkbase username + password and place it into `inventory/group_vars/splunkcloud.yml`
5. Adjust the config files to trigger the workflows/ansible playbooks.

### create/update/delete an index

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory --ask-vault-password cloud_index_config.yml

# only create/update indexes without removing anything
ansible-playbook -i inventory --ask-vault-password cloud_index_config.yml --skip-tags splunk_cloud_remove_index
```

```yaml
splunk_cloud_index_list:
  - name: "testindex"
    searchableDays: 92
    maxDataSizeMB: 1024
  - name: "testindex-2"
    datatype: "metric"
```
